The image is a still from the movie *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*.  It depicts a scene in the Dursleys' kitchen.

Specifically:

* **Dudley Dursley:** is in the foreground, having his eyes covered by his aunt Petunia. He appears apprehensive or anticipating something.  He's wearing a red and black argyle sweater.

* **Harry Potter:** is in the background, to the right. He's calmly cooking or preparing something at the stove. He's wearing a grey t-shirt and glasses.  His expression contrasts with Dudley's.

* **Petunia Dursley:** (partially visible) is covering Dudley's eyes, suggesting a surprise or a game. She is wearing a pink sweater.

The overall scene suggests a contrast between the two cousins: Dudley, anticipating something unpleasant (likely a birthday surprise that he might not enjoy), and Harry calmly going about a task.  The setting is clearly the Dursleys' mundane and somewhat unwelcoming home, highlighting Harry's outsider status within the family.
